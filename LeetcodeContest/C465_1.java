//Contest 465_P1 : Restore Finishing Order

// You are given an integer array order of length n and an integer array friends.

// order contains every integer from 1 to n exactly once, representing the IDs of the participants of a race in their finishing order.
// friends contains the IDs of your friends in the race sorted in strictly increasing order. Each ID in friends is guaranteed to appear in the order array.
// Return an array containing your friends' IDs in their finishing order.

// Example 1:

// Input: order = [3,1,2,5,4], friends = [1,3,4]

// Output: [3,1,4]

// Explanation:

// The finishing order is [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]. Therefore, the finishing order of your friends is [3, 1, 4].

// Example 2:

// Input: order = [1,4,5,3,2], friends = [2,5]

// Output: [5,2]

// Explanation:

// The finishing order is [1, 4, 5, 3, 2]. Therefore, the finishing order of your friends is [5, 2].
